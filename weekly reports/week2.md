# Team Report

## Last Week’s Goals:
- Begin integration of the Weather API and test basic data retrieval.
- Start working on UI/UX designs for the main weather display screen.
- Implement a prototype of the weather guessing game.
- Define a plan for non-functional requirements, including security.

## Progress and Issues:
- Set up React Native environment and organized frontend files.
- Researched weather APIs.
- Developed wireframes for the user interface.
- Encountered errors displaying the app on Android/iOS.
- Investigated smooth integration of a guessing game feature.
## Next Week’s Goals:
- Resolve errors encountered when running the app on Android/iOS devices to ensure a smooth deployment.
- Finalize the UI design for core weather features and integrate the designs into the app.
- Continue developing the prototype for the weather guessing game, focusing on user interaction and functionality.
- Collaborate on integrating the NOAA API effectively, ensuring accurate data retrieval and display.
- Discuss and establish a strategy for storing API data, potentially using MongoDB for user predictions and streak tracking.
- Ensure all team members assist each other with challenges related to API integration and app functionality.

## Victor Liu
**Last Week’s Goals:**
- Research weather APIs and understand how to integrate them with the app.
- Collaborate on API integration and ensure data retrieval is accurate.
- Assist in developing the logic for the weather guessing game framework.

### Progress and Issues:
- Integrated the NOAA API to fetch live weather data.
- Currently experimenting with the API to understand its structure and the data it returns.
- Since the location needs to be in longitude and latitude, might also use a geolocation api for location services.
- Still figuring out how to effectively store the retrieved data from the API for user predictions and streak tracking.


### Next Week’s Goals:
- Continue experimenting with the NOAA API to clarify data usage.
- Develop a strategy for storing API data, potentially using MongoDB.
- Collaborate with teammates to discuss the best methods for integrating the API data into the app.
- Begin working on the logic for the weather guessing game framework once the data storage strategy is established.
