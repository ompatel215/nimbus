### Last Week’s Goals:
- Research other weather APIs that can fetch weather data from other countries.
- Integrate a new weather API to complement NOAA, allowing the application to fetch weather data worldwide instead of being limited to the USA.
- Begin exploring the design and functionality of the user login interface

### Progress and Issues:
- Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API, which allows for fetching data from all over the world, compared to NOAA’s USA-only data.
- Worked on UI display for better presentation of weather information.
- OpenWeatherMap API lacks advanced data, is limited in forecast details, and is limited to 60 API calls per minute or 1,000,000 API calls per month.

### Next Week’s Goals:
- Improve the user interface for better weather data presentation, making it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
- Optimize the OpenWeatherMap API integration to reduce the number of API calls and efficiently handle the free plan limitations.
- Begin working on the user login interface and explore options for user authentication.
- Start saving and displaying user-specific weather predictions and streak data, tying it to the login system.
