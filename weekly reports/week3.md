# Team Report

## Last Week’s Goals:

- Resolve errors encountered when running the app on Android/iOS devices to ensure a smooth deployment.
- Finalize the UI design for core weather features and integrate the designs into the app.
- Continue developing the prototype for the weather guessing game, focusing on user interaction and functionality.
- Collaborate on integrating the NOAA API effectively, ensuring accurate data retrieval and display.
- Discuss and establish a strategy for storing API data, potentially using MongoDB for user predictions and streak tracking.
- Ensure all team members assist each other with challenges related to API integration and app functionality.

## Progress and Issues:

- Continued work on resolving UI display issues for iOS and Android devices.
- Made progress on finalizing UI designs for core weather features.
- Explored options for data storage, including MongoDB for user predictions and streak tracking.
- Ongoing challenges with displaying the application UI on iOS devices.
- Android simulation still requires further development and troubleshooting.

## Next Week’s Goals:

- Prioritize resolving UI display issues for both iOS and Android platforms.
- Complete the integration of finalized UI designs into the app.
- Continue refining the NOAA API integration, focusing on data accuracy and efficient retrieval.
- Implement a prototype of the data storage solution for user predictions and streak tracking.
- Develop a working prototype of the weather guessing game feature.
- Conduct thorough testing of the app's functionality across different devices and simulators.

## Victor Liu
**Last Week’s Goals:**
- Work on integrating the NOAA API.  
- Research how to retrieve and use geolocation coordinates within React Native for the weather guessing game.

### Progress and Issues:

- Integrated NOAA API and continued experimenting with data retrieval.  
- Researched and explored various methods to incorporate geolocation coordinates using React Native, though optimizing the integration is still a work in progress.  
- Encountering challenges with displaying the user interface on iOS and Android devices, which has delayed some testing and further development.  
- Struggling to effectively integrate the NOAA API with the app's core features due to issues with  UI loading across platforms.


### Next Week’s Goals:

- Finalize the geolocator integration and ensure that the coordinates retrieved are accurate and functioning properly within the app.  
- Continue refining the NOAA API integration to improve data accuracy and response time.  
- Assist in implementing data storage solutions, particularly for storing weather predictions and user streaks.
