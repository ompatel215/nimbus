# Team Report

## Last Week’s Goals:
Since this is the first week, this section is empty.

## Progress and Issues:

### Completed:
- Established the GitHub repository for version control.
- Outlined the core features: allow the user to enter the current location to get weather, allow the user to guess the temperature of the selected location, track how many correct predictions users submitted for select locations, and compare user predictions with real-time temperatures from NOAA API
- Defined stretch goals, including weather-based suggestions, severe weather alerts, and a leaderboard for successful guesses.

### Issues:
- Some team members need more time to become familiar with integrating the Weather API.
- Deciding on the most intuitive way to implement the weather guessing game while keeping the interface user-friendly.

## Learnings:
- Researched several weather APIs to find the best match for functionality and cost.

## Next Week’s Goals:
- Begin integration of the Weather API and test basic data retrieval.
- Start working on UI/UX designs for the main weather display screen.
- Implement a prototype of the weather guessing game.
- Define a plan for non-functional requirements, including security.
