# Team Report

## Last Week’s Goals:
Since this is the first week, this section is empty.

## Progress and Issues:

### Completed:
- Established the GitHub repository for version control.
- Outlined the core features: current location weather, 5-day forecast, weather condition icons, and the weather guessing game.
- Defined stretch goals, including weather-based suggestions and severe weather alerts.

### Issues:
- Some team members need more time to become familiar with integrating the Weather API.
- Deciding on the most intuitive way to implement the weather guessing game while keeping the interface user-friendly.

## Learnings:
- Researched several weather APIs to find the best match for functionality and cost.
- Recognized the importance of scalability early, especially with the possibility of handling a 50% user increase in the first year.
